# lucewind-bitter-coast
Bitter Coast overhaul made to my personal tastes. The intention is to be lore-friendly while adding 

# Modules:

## Seyda Neen: Damp Little Squat
Expands Seyda Neen using Nwahs & Mushrooms Seyda Neen as a base. Seyda Neen is described as the gateway to Vvardenfell, and the Coast Guard is said to operate from there, but there's very few signs of these things being true in the vanilla game. SNDLS fixes that by adding a few buildings - a coast guard outpost, some taverns, a few new houses - and a cast of new NPCs who either work for the coast guard or have newly arrived in Vvardenfell as colonists. 

* Adds the Seyda Neen Coast Guard
* Adds two taverns: The Glass Parrot and the Half Mast Hostel. One is distinctly more reputable than the other - and the locals will have things to say about it.
* Some new houses for the locals
* Clutter to make Seyda Neen feel lived in
* Many new NPCs, most of whom have at least a little unique dialogue
* Overhauled the interior of Arrille's Tradehouse
* Overhauled the interior of the Census & Excise office. The warehouse is now separate, there are cells for prisoners, and Sellus Gravius gets a room of his own. Also, the interior now matches the exterior better - there were windows on the ext but not on the int!
* Fargoth's ring is now found on the floor beside the barrel, so people roleplaying law-abiding characters don't have to break character and steal from the barrel to continue.

### Included Mods
* Seyda Neen by Nwahs and Mushrooms
* Fargoth's Ring Unbarrelled by Lucevar
* Nineholes at Arrille's by Lucevar
* AST Arrille's Attic by Aisis

## LW - Rainforest of the Bitter Coast by viKING
One of my favourite mods, and one I've been playing with for at least the last 15 years. Makes the BC feel truly lush and swampy by adding a lot of trees. I've kept the core mod mostly intact, but have made numerous changes to make it compatible with various other mods, including:

* Graht Trees
* Grahtwood Roost
* OAAB Brother Juniper's Twin Lamps
* Expedition to Mzelthuand

## LW BC - Dungeons and Encounters

Includes:  
* Swap Addamasartus and Samarys by magerrer
Swaps the positions of the two dungeons, to reduce the absurdity of bandits operating from right outside of town. It never felt sensible in the base game, and it feels even *less* sensible in my expanded Seyda Neen. I've tweaked dialogue and object placement for better compatibility  
* The Plague Doctor by RuffinVangarr & Katya
I've removed the bats, dimmed the lights, renamed the cell, and added some dialogue to better integrate the doctor into the game. 
[-]-- I've also added a little something to Addamasartus to better tie the two dungeons together.
* OAAB Greater Samarys by Varlothen
* Vennin's Addamasartus by Vennin
[-] Removed duplicate NPCs, made it compatible with Swapped Addamasartus & Samarys
* Vennin's Abernanit by Vennin
* Weird Science
* LeFemme Gold Texture
* Smuggler's Run by Corsair

## LW BC - Hla Oad
Includes:
* The Drop Off
* Hla Oad by Nwahs and Mushrooms

### COM Patch
* Based on RandomPal's edit of CoM. Makes my Seyda Neen edits compatible with CoM.

### LW - Regional Weather Tweaks
* Makes the weather in the BC much rainier and foggier in general
* Adds a chance of ash storms in almost all parts of Vvardenfell
* Makes rain and fog overall a bit more likely
