Replaces the chargen release identification scroll with icon, mesh and textures from Korana's "Authentic Documents" modder's resource.

Credits:
Korana for the meshes/textures, someone else for the icons (Korana couldn't remember the name, so I can't know who it was - but thank you to whoever it was).
