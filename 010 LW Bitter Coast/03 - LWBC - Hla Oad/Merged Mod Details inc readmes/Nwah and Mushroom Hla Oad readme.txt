Hla Oadï»¿


Detailing Hla Oad to make this village more habitable. More defined boundaries. Fences! At the same time, we wanted to show Hla Oad to the poor village, as Camonna Tong intended. Optional constant cloudy, foggy and rainy weather MWSE mod. According to some in-game dialogue, this helps the smugglers in the village and the secret port nearby.

Fatleg's Drop Off is also decorated.
