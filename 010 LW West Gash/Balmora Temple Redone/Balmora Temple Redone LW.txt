Balmora Temple Redone Reintegrated by Lucevar
Requires original mod by Markond

- Uses the Compatibility version by StaticNation as a base
- Renamed Temple, Main Temple to Temple, Temple Hall
- Moved some of the NPCs back into the vanilla part of the temple
- Removed the shops from the Hall; moved their clutter back into the vanilla temple
- Converted the top room of the vanilla temple into a domeless room with offices and shrines. Thanks Stele for the mesh!
- Recluttered a lot of the temple.
- Small quest and flavour dialogue (speak to Telis Salvani)

Credits: 
- Markond for Balmora Temple Redone
- StaticNation for creating the original compatibility version
- Stele for creating the version of velothiroom_8 with the flat ceiling for me
