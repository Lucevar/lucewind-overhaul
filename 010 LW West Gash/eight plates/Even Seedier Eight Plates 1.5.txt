Even Seedier Eight Plates
by Lucevar
v1.5


Visual overhaul of the Eight Plates tavern in Balmora
 ﻿- Now you can see the namesake Eight Plates - and steal them!
﻿ - A new balcony and private parlour on the upper level, overlooking the bar
﻿ - Animated NPCs to provide a more lifelike atmosphere
﻿ - A bard with custom music
﻿ - A proper kitchen for Dulnea Ralaal
 - A better room for rent - correspondingly more expensive

Includes and expands Von Django's The Seedy Plates﻿, which means:
6 new NPCs, all with unique dialogue - some is suggestive, none is explicit
Unique dialogue for vanilla npcs 
One new Thieves Guild quest - now you can steal the Eight Plates! Talk to Habasi about jobs after you've secured Balmora's defenses.

Requirements
================

OAAB Data﻿
Tamriel Data﻿
Don't forget to register TR_Data.bsa and PT_Data.bsa!

Installation
=================

Ideally, start a new game after installing this mod. If you've already visited the Eight Plates in your existing save, some of the vanilla NPCs who received new animations may have glitchy positions.

00 Core - the main files of the mod
01 Correspondences of Morrowind patches - just use one esp, replace the original Correspondances of Morrowind.esp 
02 MCA patches - activate in addition to MCA.esm
03 Animated Morrowind Patches - replace Abot's Animated Morrowind Merged esp. Note: if you're using RandomPal's town overhauls, you probably want to check his archives for a patch that works with ESEP and his mods.
