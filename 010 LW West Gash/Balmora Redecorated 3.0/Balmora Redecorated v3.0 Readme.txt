Balmora Redecorated v3.0
By Lucevar

=================
Requirements:
=================

Morrowind
Tribunal
Bloodmoon

The mod uses some furnishings from both expansions. It's designed to work with a few other mods, but it's not dependant on them.

=================
Description:
=================

Many of the houses and shops in Balmora are very generic, and don't reflect the personality and social status of their owners (or any personality at all). Moreover, with Children of Morrowind running, many children have no place to sleep in their assigned "parent"s house. This mod adds extra detail and clutter to 19 Balmora interiors (see the Details section below for more precise lists of what I've changed), making them more interesting to visit (and in some cases, a little more profitable to the skilled thief - although I've been careful not to include anything unbalancing). 

Homes actually feel lived in now. Everything I've added has a reason to exist - but I leave the interpretation to your imagination. Enjoy!

It uses entirely vanilla resources, and won't overwrite any resources you have installed or invalidate your save games.

The mod has been cleaned with Enchanted Editor, and shouldn't need to be re-cleaned.

3.0 highlights:
- Now uses OAAB/TD assets
- Many ints in the commercial quarter swapped to de_mid
- Now includes an edited and extended version of RandomPal's Hlaalu Council Manor Overhaul

Changes were made to the following 21 cells:

Balmora, Astius Hanotepelus' House
Balmora, Balyn Omarel's House
Balmora, Clagius Clanler: Outfitter
Balmora, Dorisa Darvel: Bookseller
Balmora, Dralasa Nithryon: Pawnbroker
Balmora, Dralcea Arethi's House
Balmora, Dralosa Athren's House
Balmora, Draryne Thelas's House
Balmora, Fast Eddie's House
Balmora, Hecerinde's House
Balmora, Hlaalu Council Manor
Balmora, Meldor: Armorer
Balmora, Nalcarya of White Haven
Balmora, Nine Toes' House
Balmora, Rarayn Radarys' House
Balmora, Ra'Virr: Trader
Balmora, Tsiya's House
Balmora, Tyermaillin's House
Balmora, Vorar Helas' House
Balmora, Vori's House
Balmora, West Gash Region, -2,-2 
Balmora, West Gash Region, -3,-2 

Balmora exterior cells: Nothing has been added to these cells; they're marked as changed only because I had to move door markers so that the player isn't stuck on the new furniture.

I haven't changed any of the taverns in Balmora. Instead, I recommend the following mods:

South Wall, Den of Iniquity by Balastruthius
The Seedy Plates by Von Django
Lucky Lockup Additions by Midgetalien
Balmora Guilds Expanded (also by me)

=================
Installation:
=================

1. Extract this archive to any folder and then copy the contents to Morrowind's Data Files folder.
2. Start Morrowind Launcher, click Data Files, and enable Balmora Redecorated v2.1.esp

=================
Un-Installation:
=================

1. Save your game in a cell, preferably an interior, that isn't affected by this mod, and close Morrowind.
2. Start Morrowind Launcher, click Data Files, and disable the Morrowind Interior Decoration - Balmora.esp file(s).
3. Delete the .esp file from your Morrowind/Data Files folder.


=================
Compatibility:
=================

Beautiful Cities of Morrowind - it contains an edited version of this mod, so they're incompatible. Don't use them together.

Epic Balmora - There's a very, very minor issue, in that Epic Balmora adds a keg where I add a bed in Astius Hanotepelus's House. 

Other than that, no conflicts that I'm aware of. Any mod that edits any of the same cells as this one have the possibility of conflicting.

If you find a mod that conflicts, please let me know so I can update this and create a patch.

Particular Notes:

Should be loaded before any lighting mods such as TLM, so that their ambient lighting changes can take effect. I've cleaned this mod of the automatic ambience changes the CS makes, but it's still a good idea to load this earlier just in case.

Compatible with Children of Morrowind (it was made as a companion mod of sorts, although it doesn't require COM) - Clagius Clanler, Tsiya and Dralcea Arethi's children 
now have beds to sleep in.

Compatible with Nemon's Balmora Interiorator - we only touch two of the same cells, and even then, we edit completely different parts of the building. You could run the two together for an even more complete Balmora interior overhaul :)

Known Issues:
=================

If you run the full version without Children of Morrowind installed, some NPCs will have extra beds for children that don't actually exist, which may seem strange. Please use the "non-COM" version in the Extras folder if that bothers you. The mod itself will run perfectly fine without COM installed though.
