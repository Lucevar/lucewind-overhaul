Description
============
*Part of the Morrowind May Modathon Month 2019*

Fatleg's Drop Off... Maybe you stopped at that little shack of a tradehouse once or twice looking for someone in Hla Oad to unload some loot. Maybe you visited it as part of a minor quest. But really, it wasn't very interesting aesthetically. With a heavily-modded game, I noticed that the smuggler's den looked really barren and didn't quite fit into a modern playthrough. This mod remedies that, making the Drop Off a more interesting place to visit.

This mod furnishes the smuggler's cave under Hla Oad, Fatleg's Drop Off so that it resembles more of a hastily-constructed warheouse and hideout for the Camonna Tong. This mod also adds some merchandise to the tradehouse above. The optional file includes a small extension to Hla Oad's docks. In the optional file, you will also see lights dotting the docks, as I felt the fishing village didn't have enough light. Without a lighthouse and any lights, how could boats find this town tucked away amongst the Bitter Coast trees? 

This is my first mod submitted to the Nexus, and I am happy to accept any constructive feedback.

Permissions
============
You may modify this mod without permission, but please credit me as the original author if you wish to do so. Also, a courtesy message on the Nexus would be appreciated so I can see whether this little mod grows any wings and takes flight.

=============
Installation
=============
For an automatic mod installation, use the mod manager of your choice. For a manual install, drag the .esp file into your Data Files directory. Then, make sure to activate the .esp in your launcher or mod manager. When you install mods that change interior or exterior cells, it would be best to start a new game or continue from a save file that has not entered the altered cells.

========
Removal
========
Delete the .esp from your directory to uninstall the mod. It's as simple as that! Be careful about uninstalling mods mid-playthrough, though. Objects and other cell changes from uninstalled mods can persist if the saved game isn't properly cleaned. 

==================
Incompatibilities
==================
Morrowind Rebirth -- you will see some floating barrels in the warehouse as well as some crates and chests in the smith's area which block access to the level with the pawnbroker. This issue can be fixed pretty easily and quickly with the console or the construction set. 

==========
Changelog
==========
1.0 -- Initial release of the mod, including changes to underground warehouse, goods in tradehouse, lights on the docks, extension to the dock.

1.5 -- Updated release based on feedback (thank you, MelchiorDahrk) which fixed pathgrid, dims the Drop Off, and fixes a dialogue issue. Edits to the docks of Hla Oad, including the lights, are included in a separate .esp.
