- Edited Rufinus Alleius's stats (unarmoured down, light armour up) so he wears his hat
- Fixed pathgrids in a lot of the cells (Grand Council Chambers, Imperial Chapels, Imperial Commission etc)
- Minor clutter edits in the Ducal Chambers with new OAAB assets

Distant past:
================
Deleted extra copy of Asciene Rane
Caretaker background -> now only available to NPCs of that class
Edits transport to vvardenfell script to deposit you on the platform instead of the void
