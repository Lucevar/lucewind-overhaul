# Seyda Neen - Damp Little Squat
* Started with Seyda Neen by hater8 as a base

* Added Rainforest of the Bitter Coast. Edited it for compatibility with this and Shipyards of Vvardenfell.
* Edited Nine-Holes at Arrilles to remove the Nine-Holes board (lol) for compatibility with Nine-Holes by Dillon, which is objectively superior
* Moved stuff around in Arrille's basement. Got rid of the kegs, put in a bed and some furniture - Arrille now has somewhere to stay! The room upstairs is just too bare to be his, clearly one of the people loitering around there is renting it (Elone or Tandram, probably).
